        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A roll is a small, usually round or oblong individual loaf of bread served as a meal accompaniment (eaten plain or with butter).Rolls can be served and eaten whole or are also commonly cut and filled – the result of doing so is considered a sandwich in American English; in British English (and some other national varieties of English, such as Australian), the word sandwich is defined more narrowly, to require bread sliced from a loaf, and hence a cut-and-filled bread roll is not a sandwich; it is commonly called simply a roll.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 cup quinoa</li>
            <li>1 can black beans</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
            <li>½ cup fresh spinach leaves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons barbeque sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>4 flour tortillas</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>While quinoa cooks, mix black beans, red bell pepper, spinach, barbeque sauce, garlic, cumin, and cayenne pepper together in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in Cheddar cheese and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cheese is completely melted, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cooked quinoa.</li>
            <li>Place tortillas on a flat work surface. Spoon filling in a line across the middle of each tortilla; fold in opposing edges to overlap the filling. Roll up as you would burritos.</li>
        </ul>
